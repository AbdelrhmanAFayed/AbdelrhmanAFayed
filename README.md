## 🌟 Coda: A Digital Cockpit

I contributed to **Coda**, an AI-driven automotive system developed as the graduation project for ITI's 9-Month Embedded Systems Track. Coda features a dual-screen interface, road sign detection with YOLOv8, a voice assistant, and ECUs built on NXP, Raspberry Pi, and Jetson Nano, using technologies like Qt6, vSOME/IP, and Yocto.
